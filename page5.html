        I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite
        ignorant of people. Even after I switched into psychology and cognitive
        science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis upon logic and
        mechanism. It took a long time for me to realize that my understanding
        of human behavior was relevant to my in- terest in the design of
        technology. As I watched people struggle with technology, it became
        clear that the difficulties were caused by the technology, not the
        people. I was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power
        plant accident at Three Mile Island (the island name comes from the fact
        that it is located on a river, three miles south of Middle- town in the
        state of Pennsylvania). In this incident, a rather simple mechanical
        failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of difficulties and
        confusion, total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a
        severe radiation release, all of which brought the American nuclear
        power industry to a complete halt. The op- erators were blamed for these
        failures: <span>“human error” </span> was the im- mediate analysis. But
        the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so
        poorly designed that error was inevi- table: design was at fault, not
        the operators. The moral was simple: we were designing things for
        people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But
        that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so
        orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better.
        Yup, that’s how I used to think.
