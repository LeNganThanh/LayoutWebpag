        leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed by a
        machine are known only by the machine and its designers. When people
        fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the machine does the
        wrong thing, its operators are blamed for not understanding the machine,
        for not following its rigid specifica- tions. With everyday objects, the
        result is frustration. With complex devices and commercial and
        industrial processes, the resulting difficulties can lead to accidents,
        injuries, and even deaths. It is time to reverse the situation: to cast
        the blame upon the machines and their design. It is the machine and its
        design that are at fault. It is the duty of machines and those who
        design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the
        arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines. The reasons for the
        deficiencies in human-machine interaction are numerous. Some come from
        the limitations of today’s technol- ogy. Some come from self-imposed
        restrictions by the designers, often to hold down cost. But most of the
        problems come from a complete lack of understanding of the design
        principles necessary for effective human-machine interaction. Why this
        deficiency? Be- cause much of the design is done by engineers who are
        experts in technology but limited in their understanding of people.
        <span> “We are people ourselves,” </span>they think,
        <span> “so we understand people.” </span> But in fact, we humans are
        amazingly complex. Those who have not studied human behavior often think
        it is pretty simple. Engineers, moreover, make the mistake of thinking
        that logical explanation is sufficient:
        <span> “If only people would read the instructions,” </span> they say,
        <span> “everything would be all right.” </span>
        Engineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to
        believe that all people must think this way, and they design their
        machines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers are upset,
        but often for the wrong reason.
        <span> “What are these people doing?” </span> they will wonder.
        <span>“Why are they doing that?” </span> The prob- lem with the designs
        of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human
        behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.
