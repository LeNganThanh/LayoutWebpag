      <h1>THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS</h1>
      <p>
        If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability
        to perform well would neither surprise nor bother me. But why should I
        have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves?
        <span>“Doors?”</span> I can hear the reader saying.
        <span>“You have trouble opening doors?” </span> Yes. I push doors that
        are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into
        doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I see others
        having the same troubles—unnecessary troubles. My problems with doors
        have become so well known that confusing doors are often called
        <span> “Norman doors.” </span>Imagine becoming famous for doors that
        don’t work right. I’m pretty sure that’s not what my parents planned for
        me. (Put <span>“Norman doors”</span> into your favorite search engine—be
        sure to include the quote marks: it makes for fascinating reading.) How
        can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to
        be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to
        a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office
        building, walking down a corridor. You come to a door. How does it open?
        Should you push or pull, on the left or the right? Maybe the door
        slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide to the
        left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling.
