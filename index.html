        <p>
          If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability
          to perform well would neither surprise nor bother me. But why should I
          have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves?
         <span>“Doors?”</span>  I can hear the reader saying. <span>“You have trouble opening
          doors?” </span> Yes. I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that
          should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but
          slide. Moreover, I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary
          troubles. My problems with doors have become so well known that
          confusing doors are often called <span> “Norman doors.” </span>Imagine becoming
          famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty sure that’s not
          what my parents planned for me. (Put <span>“Norman doors”</span>  into your favorite
          search engine—be sure to include the quote marks: it makes for
          fascinating reading.) How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing?
